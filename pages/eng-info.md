# What your brain stimulated?

### Short about the experiment: 
* Using [repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)](https://uitpsypro.github.io/1/eng-info/eng-rtms)
  * A non-invasive brain stimulation procedure
* Consists of two sessions (2 meetings):
  * Where you receive either **real rTMS stimulation** or **fake rTMS stimulation**
  * Both you, the participant, and the researchers will **not know** which stimulation you will receive to either session 
* A single session will require around 2 to 2.5 hours
* The second session will be, at minimum, 7 days after the first session
* To quality for the giftcard you must participate in both sessions


### Risk 
* This brain stimulation is very potent and **might** elicit an epileptic seizure
* HOWEVER, this is **very** rare in healthy adults


### To be able to participate you need to meet these criterias: 
* Good or corrected eyesight
* Be righthanded
* Have no psychological/neurological diseases currently or in the past (e. g. major depression, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, migraine, severe head injury, brain surgery)
* Not pregnant
* No history of epilepsy in the family (first-degree relatives)
* Not taking any medication targeting the central nervous system (e. g. antidepressants, antiepileptics)
* No metal implants (e.g., pacemaker, cochlea implant)
* No electronical devices in the body
