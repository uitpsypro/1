# What your brain stimulated?

### Short about the experiment: 
In this project we will be using rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) which is a safe procedure to stimulate the brain from outside of the skull using magnetic fields. As a participant you will conduct an attentional task and answer a few questions that will be asked while conducting this task. This study requires that you attend two sessions in total, with at least one week gap between each session. Both sessions will be identical except for that on one session you will receive **real stimulation** (which influences the brain), and the other session you will receive **fake stimulation** (have no effect on the brain). The order for real/fake stimulation will be random, you will not be told when you will receive real or fake stimulation. One session is expected to last about 140 minutes. 


### Inclusion criteria:
* You should have good or corrected eyesight

* not taking any medication targeting the central nervous system (e. g. antidepressants, antiepileptics)

### General information about the experiment:
* A single session will require around 2 to 2.5 hours
* The second session will be, at minimum, 7 days after the first session
* To quality for the giftcard you must participate in both session
