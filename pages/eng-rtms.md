# Repetetive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

* Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation. 
* During the procedure, a magnetic coil is placed over the scalp of the person receiving the treatment. 
* The magnetic field penetrates the skull and the electric stimulus activates the neurons in the target area.
* Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulation the brain activity.

* The TMS coil looks like this:
