# Repetetive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation.
* The magnetic coil is placed over the scalp of the person being stimulated.
* The magnetic field penetrates the skull and the electric stimulus activates the neurons in the brain under the coil.
* Repetitive TMS means that the magnetic field will turn on and off multiple times in a single stimulation round.
